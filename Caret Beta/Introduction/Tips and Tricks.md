# Tips and Tricks

Select a word (or several words) and:
- Hit `*` to surround it with `*`, this also works with brackets and other inline element markers like `~`, `:`, etc.
- Paste a URL to convert the selection to a link

Hit `tab`:
- to jump to the end of the current inline element, ex: *emphasis*
- to iterate through table cells
- to iterate items in the quick menu (`alt+enter`)

When you misspell a word hit `opt+enter` or `ctrl+space` to see spelling suggestions without touching the mouse.

Hit `cmd+p` and then
- write a name of a file that doesn't exist and hit `opt+enter` to create it
- do the same but end the name with a `/` to create a folder

Hit `cmd+shift+e` to open (or focus) the files sidebar and:
- Type to filter items
- Select a file and hit `enter` to open it
- Select an item and hit `cmd+enter` to open it in a tab
- Hit `cmd+n` to create a file or folder (end folder names with `/`)

Hit `cmd+shift+]` to go to the next tab or file and `cmd+shift+[` to go to the previous one.

Hit `cmd+opt+]` to go to the next sidebar item and `cmd+opt+[` to go to the previous one.
